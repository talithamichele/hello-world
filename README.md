# hello-world
Trying to actually figure out github this time around because I still have fantasies that I shall learn to progam, someday. That is, afterall, the reason I originally joined Hacker News, lo these many years ago. I was going to post the link to my very first post there as evidence of this fact, but I am unable to figure out how to copy-paste to this readme file. FINE.
